# Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot with High-Frequency Trading System

## Overview

This project integrates a reinforcement learning trading bot built in Python with a high-frequency trading system developed in Rust. The bot uses reinforcement learning to make trading decisions, while the Rust system handles high-frequency trading operations.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot:** Utilizes the A2C algorithm from Stable Baselines3 to make trading decisions.
- **High-Frequency Trading System:** Built using Rust and WebSocket for real-time trading operations.
- **Integration:** Python bot communicates with the Rust system via WebSocket.
